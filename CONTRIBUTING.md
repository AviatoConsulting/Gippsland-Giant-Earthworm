# GGE Installation and Contribution Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the GGE project on your local system, as well as how to contribute to the project.

## Installation Steps

- **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the GGE repository to your local system:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/giant_gipsland_earthworm.git
   cd giant_gipsland_earthworm
   ```

- **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Flutter installed, and then fetch the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

- **Connect to Firebase**  
   Use the [`flutterfire`](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/) CLI to connect your Flutter project to Firebase. If you haven't installed `flutterfire`, you can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

   Once `flutterfire` is installed, configure your Firebase project by running:

   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```

   Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project and platforms, and `flutterfire` will automatically generate the required configuration files.

   - **Ensure `firebase_options.dart` is generated** in your project files.
   - Make sure `google-services.json` is added in `android/app` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` is added in `ios/Runner`.

- **Google Sign-In Configuration**  
   To enable Google Sign-In, add the following configuration in your `Info.plist` for iOS:

   ```xml
   <key>GIDClientID</key>
   <!-- Copied from GoogleService-Info.plist key CLIENT_ID -->
   <string>YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE</string>
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
       <dict>
           <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
           <string>Editor</string>
           <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
           <array>
               <!-- Copied from GoogleService-Info.plist key REVERSED_CLIENT_ID -->
               <string>YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID_HERE</string>
           </array>
       </dict>
   </array>
   ```

- **Google Maps API Key Setup**  
   Add the Google Maps API keys to enable map functionality:

   - **For Android**: Add the API key in `AndroidManifest.xml` located at `android/app/src/main`.
   - **For iOS**: Add the API key in `AppDelegate.swift` located at `ios/Runner`.

   You can refer to the [Google Maps Flutter package](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) for further details.

- **Run the App**  
   Use Flutter to run the app on an emulator or connected device:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

# How to Get a Google Maps API Key

To get a Google Maps API key, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Go to the Google Cloud Console
- Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Sign in with your Google account if you haven't already.

### Step 2: Create a New Project (or Select an Existing Project)
- In the top menu, click on the project dropdown.
- Click on **New Project** if you want to create a new project, then give it a name and click **Create**.
- If you already have a project, select it from the list.

### Step 3: Enable Google Maps API Services
- With your project selected, go to the **Library** tab in the left-hand menu.
- Search for **Maps JavaScript API**, **Places API**, and **Geocoding API** (if you need more location functionalities).
- Click on each API and then click **Enable**.

### Step 4: Generate an API Key
- In the left-hand menu, go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
- Click **Create Credentials** and select **API Key**.
- Google will generate an API key for you. Copy this key as youâ€™ll need it to configure your app.

### Step 5: Add the API Key to Your Flutter Project
- **For Android**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main`, and add your API key within the `<application>` tag:

   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
       android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" />
   ```

- **For iOS**: Open `AppDelegate.swift` in `ios/Runner`, and add your API key in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` function:

   ```swift
   import GoogleMaps

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
           GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
           return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
       }
   }
   ```
